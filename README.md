Hey, I'm Josh, 

Apple Mac Technician | IT Consultant | Automation Engineer

I help everyone get more from their tech, whether that's untangling a messy Microsoft 365 tenant, locking down email security, or building tools that make repetitive work disappear.

What I Do?
- Apple Mac & IT Consulting: My bread and butter. Device management, Google Workspace, M365 administration, security hardening, and the kind of troubleshooting that requires actually understanding how systems work.
- Custom Automation: The bit you are here for. Python based tools that solve real problems: metadata extraction, transcription workflows, document processing. Not here to replace you, I'm here to give you more time to do what you want to! 

Currently Building: 
- xScribe: OpenAI's Whisper powered transcription tool for macOS
- PhotoMDE: Image metadata extraction and management
More commits coming soon, I'm finishing things properly before shipping.

Tech I Work With:
macOS, iOS, Python, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SharePoint, Mimecast, Bash, PowerShell, C++, Swift, anything I can get my hands on... 

Get In Touch! 
Building something and need a hand? Got a Mac fleet that's giving you grief? Reach me by email.
