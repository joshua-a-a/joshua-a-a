Hey, I'm Josh, 

Apple Mac Specialist | IT Consultant | Automation Engineer

What I Do
- Apple Mac & IT Consulting: Device and Domain management, Apple Business Manager, Google Workspaces, M365 administration, security hardening, from living room to conference room. 
- Custom Automation: Streamline processes that take up your time, time you can spend reviewing the work rather than downloading it, or sending remittences rather than reorganising them. 

Current Portfolio: 
- xScribe: Privacy focussed transcriber powered by OpenAI's Whisper
- PhotoMDE: Image metadata extraction and management

Currently Building: 
- EZFTP: Automated FTP downloads: point, start transfer, receive files
- PDFSplitter: Split large PDFs (100+ or even 1000+ pages) into structured files based on keywords or custom logic

More commits coming soon.

I Work With:
Apple (macOS & iOS), Windows, Linux, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Cloud Storages, Domain Management, Python, Bash, PowerShell, C++, Swift, anything I can get my hands on...
